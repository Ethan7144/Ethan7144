 ### Who am I? 
 Hello there! My name is Ethan, and I am currently a Software Engineer on the Gateway team at CIMON Automation. I work on enabling communication between industrial devices and our HMI application, Canvas. My team implements and maintains protocol support (like Modbus), sends and recieves frame data, and ensures it integrates seamlessly into the runtime environment.
